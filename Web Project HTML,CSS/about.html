 <h1>A brief history about us</h1>
 <h4>Michelangelo Corporation is an American coffee company and coffeehouse chain. It was founded in Seattle, Washington in 1971. As of 2017, the company operates 27,339 locations worldwide.</h4>
<h4>It is considered the main representative of "second wave coffee", initially distinguishing itself from other coffee-serving venues in the US by taste, quality, and customer experience while popularizing darkly roasted coffee.</h4>
<h4>Our shop locations serve hot and cold drinks, whole-bean coffee, microground instant coffee known as VIA, espresso, caffe latte, Frappuccino beverages, La Boulange pastries, and snacks. </h4>
<h4> We first became profitable in Seattle in the early 1980s. Despite an initial economic downturn with its expansion into the Midwest and British Columbia in the late 1980s, the company experienced revitalized prosperity with its entry into California in the early 1990s.</h4>
